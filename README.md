# MLX_DeepLearning_MLOPS

**Week 1 - Learning Deep about Deep learning..!**

    Challenge - Iris classification with Neural Networks ( without the usage of PyTorch/TensorFlow ðŸ˜’ )
    
    --- Learnings..! (What worked well) ðŸ¤—
    
    -Visualizing every step happening behind and understanding the architecture.
    -Backpropagation in depth.
    -Small model - super sensitive to changes in hyperparameters.
    -The maths - #chainrule #differentiation
    -Deployment - #git #github #docker #fastapi
